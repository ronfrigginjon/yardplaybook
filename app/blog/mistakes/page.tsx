      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Mowing too short (scalping):</strong> Follow the 1/3 rule‚Äînever remove more than a
          third of the blade in one cut. Higher mowing shades soil, reduces weeds, and deepens roots.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shallow, frequent watering:</strong> Water deeply and less often to train roots
          down. Most lawns thrive on ~1 inch/week total.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Guessing on fertilizer:</strong> Get a soil test and follow seasonal rates. Too
          much nitrogen creates thatch, disease, and rapid‚Äîweak‚Äîtop growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ignoring soil health:</strong> Aerate compacted areas, add organic matter, and
          keep thatch under ¬Ω&quot;.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skipping prep before seeding:</strong> Seed needs soil contact. Rake, dethatch,
          and consider aeration before overseeding.
        </li>
      </ol>
